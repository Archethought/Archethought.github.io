__Transform Your Conversations Through Knowledge__


## Platform Summary
Archethought solves indoor positioning (micro-location) problems by locating people and assets with high accuracy. 
Using tools developed for space exploration, Archethought Smart Venue™ innovates by combining open source
sensor systems with cloud-based algorithms to capture, process and visually display locations and tracks.

## Problems
How can our cities identify and solve noise issues among residents and events?
What noise levels are affecting our city and where do they originate?
When do most noise complaints happen and where?
* Existing solutions don't provide information to all affected parties
* When noise complaints are reported, it's difficult to obtain actual data
* Too many resources are used to address complaints that often recur without resolution

## Solutions
Archethought Smart Venue™ Technology provides a mobile or permanent installation to monitor noise levels.
* Sensors are simple, low cost, and easy to deploy
* Calibrated Class 2 monitors are used, with yearly calibration
* Data is posted in near real-time to a Web app, providing a reference for all affected parties
* Data is stored permanently, providing future evidence to analyze full urban noise patterns

## FAQ
<u>What is different from available solutions?</u>  
We immediately provide accurate data that you cannot obtain without expensive equipment and special skills.  
By storing data in the cloud, you can also provide future analytics for planning.

<u>Will city employees and residents use a smartphone to view the data?</u>  
Yes. Remember when you didn't have a smartphone, GPS, and navigation? We're just repeating history, because when someone wants key information and they find it, they'll find a device to get it.

<u>Are the display solutions customizable?</u>  
Yes. We provide a white label mechanism to include logo and other municipal information for the easy-to-use web interface.
