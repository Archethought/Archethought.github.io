## Introducing Jekyll themes

[Jekyll themes](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes) really aren't *themes* at all, but simply layouts which are pre-developed site pages you can add to the github.io repository and then expand upon. No magic.  Many are highly complex, pulling setup definitions from who knows where and ignoring the local css stylesheet.  __Caution!__

With Jekyll, you can modify your site; i.e., add a blog, and then serve it locally before committing with `bundle exec jekyll serve`

## Open Sourced on GitHub

Most are freely available on github.  [Made Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes) has some very nice ones.
[Flex](http://the-development.github.io/flex/) is a good basic one.
