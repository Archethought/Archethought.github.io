Archethought, founded in 2008, recently pivoted from data science consulting to commercialize micro-location technology, a rapidly growing field mapping indoor human and asset location. The company offers a subscription platform to deliver applications based on micro-location tracking data, using inexpensive, open source sensor hardware. Portions of the technology were developed to support astronaut wellness on the NASA Mars Mission.
