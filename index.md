Archethought is commercializing urban monitoring technology, assisting city managers, planners and residents by creating conversations around data and their environments. We are deploying urban noise monitoring systems to help cities avoid costs from noise complaints, and improve quality of living.

We are seeking Pilot Partners to develop and deploy solutions. Contact us to arrange a pilot for your organization.
