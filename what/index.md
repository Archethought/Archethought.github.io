## Smart Infrastructure & IoT
_Working with the Community to Create Revolutionary Solutions_

Smart Infrastructure is about creating sustainable communities, social heath, better farming & water conservation practices along with healthy economies. Using the Internet of Things like beacons and sensors we can collect large amounts of data that allow us to monitor, change, and develop better ways of living. IoT can be designed for large projects as well as small.

## Technology Meetups
Archethought hosts, sponsors, and helps organize numerous meetups related to startups, data, and music in Longmont. We would love to see you at the next one!

## Brown Bags
Both internally and externally, we hold bring-your-own-lunch and laptop "brown bag" sessions that teach participants something new in bite-sized chunks.

## Volunteer Activities & Projects

Archethought engages in community volunteerism at a High School Library, FIRST Robotics club, and through civic engagement, startups, the arts, and makerspaces. We volunteer over 1,000 hours per year, a proud accomplishment we are happy to continue.

Besides the work we do for our clients and services, Archethought also nurtures experimentation and learning. We are always looking for new startup ideas, technologies to explore, and things to inspire us.
