[We are techonology developers of exceptionally strong character.](http://www.archethought.com/)

The Archethought team has a wide variety of skill sets and diciplines from backend development, frontend design, to circuit and sensor implementation. We look to cultivate a team environment that is fun and engaging with the opportunity to learn new things and explore new technologies.

* We work with and collect big data sets, then combine your data with tools that bring you insight
* Using Beacons and Sensors, we gather data and seek to create learning and actionable observations
* We excel in front-end and backend development, creating Apps, APIs, and Services

# What We Do

## Smart Infrastructure & IoT
_Working with the Community to Create Revolutionary Solutions_

Smart Infrastructure is about creating sustainable communities, social heath, better farming & water conservation practices along with healthy economies. Using the Internet of Things like beacons and sensors we can collect large amounts of data that allow us to monitor, change, and develop better ways of living. IoT can be designed for large projects as well as small.

## Technology Meetups
Archethought hosts, sponsors, and helps organize numerous meetups related to startups, data, and music in Longmont. We would love to see you at the next one!

## Brown Bags
Both internally and externally, we hold bring-your-own-lunch and laptop "brown bag" sessions that teach participants something new in bite-sized chunks.

## Volunteer Activities & Projects

Archethought engages in community volunteerism at a High School Library, FIRST Robotics club, and through civic engagement, startups, the arts, and makerspaces. We volunteer over 1,000 hours per year, a proud accomplishment we are happy to continue.

Besides the work we do for our clients and services, Archethought also nurtures experimentation and learning. We are always looking for new startup ideas, technologies to explore, and things to inspire us.
